# SDL++: A C++ Layer For SDL (Simple Direct Media Library) #

## 1. Overview ##

SDL++ is a C++ layer on top of SDL. It provides wrapper classes for SDL functionality. Highlights include
- templated event, timer, and task classes that provide a type-safe way to send event data from event sources to listeners
- decentralized event dispatch and handling
- handy wrapper classes for almost all SDL types.
